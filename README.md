# GAN Attack against Federated Deep Learning

This project is the reproduction of the paper [Deep Models Under the GAN: Information Leakage from Collaborative Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07464.pdf). The details of this project are not exactly the same as the paper, but it can show the effect of this kind of attack, which uses the gan to capture the information of other participants' data.
